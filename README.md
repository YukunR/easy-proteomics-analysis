#### Download and Install RStudio (Recommended)

1. Go to [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
2. Download RStudio Desktop (free version)
3. Install RStudio after R installation is complete

### Step 2: Set Up the Project Environment

#### Open RStudio and Install renv

```r
# Install renv package manager
install.packages("renv")
```

#### Clone or Download This Project

1. Download the project files to your computer
2. Open RStudio
3. Go to File â†’ Open Project and select the project folder
4. Or set working directory: `setwd("path/to/your/project")`

#### Restore Package Environment

```r

renv::restore()
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data Files

Ensure you have the following files in the `data/` folder:

#### Sample Information File (See `data/sample_info.txt` for an example.)

Tab-separated file with sample names and groups:

```
Sample	Group
NC_1	NC
NC_2	NC
NC_3	NC
HC_1	HC
HC_2	HC
HC_3	HC
HD_1	HD
HD_2	HD
HD_3	HD
```

#### Protein Expression Data (See `data/origin_data.txt` for an example.)

Tab-separated file with protein expression values (first columns should be protein annotations, followed by sample columns)

### Step 2: Modify Configuration Script

Modify the `Configs` section in `main.R`, then run the script with `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`.

### Step 3: Monitor Progress (Optional)

```r
# Check current status
check_status()

# View configuration
print_config()
```

## Common Operations

### Resume After Interruption

If analysis is interrupted (power failure, manual interruption, etc.), simply rerun the same command:

```r
result <- run_proteomics_analysis()
```

### Rerun Specific Steps

```r
# Rerun normalization step
rerun_step("normalization")

# Rerun multiple steps
rerun_step(c("pca", "differential_analysis_KI_vs_Old"))

# Rerun all differential analysis for all comparison groups
rerun_step(c("differential_analysis_KI_vs_Old",
            "differential_analysis_Old_vs_Young",
            "differential_analysis_KI_vs_Young"))
```

### Start Fresh

```r
# Safe cleanup (with confirmation prompt)
clean_project_safe()

# Then rerun analysis
result <- run_proteomics_analysis()
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Analysis restarted from beginning after interruption?**

```r
# Check project status
check_status()

# Use troubleshooting tool
troubleshoot()

# If interrupted step detected, reset status
reset_interrupted()
```

**Q: A step keeps failing?**

```r
# View detailed logs
check_status()  # Shows last 10 log lines

# Force rerun that step
rerun_step("step_name")
```

**Q: Want to change parameters and reanalyze?**

```r
# After modifying configuration parameters, clean project
clean_project_safe()

# Rerun analysis
result <- run_proteomics_analysis()
```

### Diagnostic Tools

```r
# Comprehensive troubleshooting
troubleshoot()

# Check project status
check_status()

# Verify project structure
verify_files()

# Reset interrupted state
reset_interrupted()

# View current configuration
print_config()
```

### Log Files

Detailed execution logs are saved in `[base_dir]/analysis.log`, containing start time, completion status, and error messages for each step.

## Understanding Results

### Differential Expression Results

- `log2_fold_change`: Log2 fold change; positive values indicate upregulation, negative values indicate downregulation
- `p_value`: Statistical test p-value
- `regulation_group`: Regulation direction ("up", "down", "ns")

### Enrichment Analysis Results

- `p.adjust`: Multiple testing corrected p-value
- `Count`: Number of genes enriched in this pathway
- `GeneRatio`: Ratio of enriched genes to input genes

## Best Practices for Beginners

### Before Starting

1. Ensure your sample information file matches exactly with sample names in expression data
2. Check that group names in comparisons match those in sample_info.txt
3. Verify all required data files are in the correct locations

### During Analysis

1. Don't close R/RStudio while analysis is running
2. Monitor the console output for any error messages
3. If you see errors, use `troubleshoot()` for guidance

### After Completion

1. Check the `[base_dir]/analysis.log` file for any warnings
2. Verify that all expected output files were generated
3. Review the normalization plots before interpreting differential expression results

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Run `troubleshoot()` for diagnostic information
2. Check `[base_dir]/analysis.log` for detailed error messages
3. Verify data file formats are correct
4. Ensure all required R packages are properly installed

## Package Management with renv

This project uses `renv` for reproducible package management:

# Update packages
renv::update()

# Create snapshot of current packages
renv::snapshot()
```
